## Tweaks

### Aether Current Helper

Clicking on a zone in the Aether Currents window opens a helper window that shows where to find the aether currents or which quests unlocks them. Clicking on an aether current in the list flags the position of the aether current or the quest giver on the map.

### Auto Sort Armoury Chest

Sorts items inside the Armoury Chest upon opening it.

Uses the games `/itemsort` command for sorting. Condition and order are configurable.

### Character Class Switcher

Clicking on a class/job in the character window finds the matching gearset and equips it.

Features:

- Always equips the matching gearset with the highest average item level
- Supports crafter jobs
  - Hold shift to open the original desynthesis window if needed
- Supports controller input
  - Checks the controller button with "Select Target/Confirm" binding
  - Technical limitation: desynthesis window still only opens when holding shift on a keyboard
- Supports PvP Character window
- Adds hover effect for non-crafters
- Option to disable Tooltips

> **Note**
> In order for this tweak to work properly, please make sure "Character Window Job Switcher" is disabled in Simple Tweaks.

### Commands

A variety of useful chat commands. Each command is separately toggleable.

Available Commands:

- `/itemlink <id>`
  - Prints an item link for the given item id in chat.
- `/whatmount`
  - Target a player and execute the command to see what mount your target is riding and which item teaches this mount.

### Custom Chat Timestamp

As it says, configurable chat timestamp format. Uses C#'s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">`DateTime.ToString()`</a> to format.

### DTR

Shows Instance, FPS and Busy status in DTR bar. To enable/disable elements or to change the order go into Dalamud Settings > Server Info Bar.

### Enhanced Experience Bar

Enhances the Experience Bar with the following modes:

- The PvP Series Bar shows series rank and experience. A little * after the rank indicates a claimable rank-up reward.
- The Sanctuary Bar shows sanctuary level and island experience.

Available options include:

- Always show PvP Series Bar in PvP Areas
- Always show Sanctuary Bar on the Island
- Hide Job on Sanctuary Bar
- Max Level Override
  - Will switch to the selected bar if your current job is on max level and none of the settings above apply.
- Disable color change

> **Note**
> In order for this tweak to work properly, please make sure "Show Experience Percentage" is disabled in Simple Tweaks.

### Expert Deliveries

Always opens the "Grand Company Delivery Missions" window on the "Expert Delivery" tab.

Auto-unmutes background music for cutscenes started by quests? I'm not sure. But it works most of the time when I want it to. :D
