# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### New Tweak: Safer Market Board Price Check

Prevents you from checking market board prices while a request is running, minimizing the frequency of encountering the "Please wait and try your search again" screen.

### Aether Current Helper

- **Changed:** The window now has a button in its title bar to lock/unlock its position and size.
- **Changed:** The window does no longer resets its size upon opening.

### Gear Set List

- **Changed:** The window now has a button in its title bar to lock/unlock its position and size. The window context menu was removed.
- **Changed:** The window now has a minimum size to make sure it always shows all columns.

## [19.1.0] (2023-11-07)

### Search the markets

- **Added:** Support for Recipes List window.

## [19.0.5] (2023-11-04)

### Enhanced Material List

Reworked internals to make the following changes:

- **Fixed:** The plugin will now respect the refresh button state and won't trigger a refresh while a refresh is already running.
- **Fixed:** The game will no longer crash when the plugin unloads while the material list was open.

## [19.0.4] (2023-10-10)

### HaselTweaks

- **Changed:** Dropped the SVG rendering library and replaced the logo in the settings with a simple PNG image. Making it scaleable with the UI was a nice thought, but in the end it just wasn't worth it.

## [19.0.3] (2023-10-06)

### Glamour Dresser Armoire Alert

- **Fixed:** Info text didn't display correctly due to changed translation key.

## [19.0.2] (2023-10-06)

### Enhanced Isleworks Agenda

## [19.0.1] (2023-10-06)

### Enhanced Isleworks Agenda

- **Fixed?:** Possible fix for a game crash when searching for an item without having all items unlocked yet.  
  (Because I'm already at rank 18 and have all items unlocked it's a guessing game for me as to why it crashes.)

## [19.0.0] (2023-10-06)

### New Tweak: Simple Aethernet List

Simplifies the behavior of the Aethernet list: mouseover selects the aetheryte and a click teleports you.

## [18.0.4] (2023-10-06)

### Lock Window Position

- **Fixed:** Game crashed upon clicking the context menu entry.

## [18.0.3] (2023-10-05)

### Character Class Switcher

- **Fixed:** Tweak didn't work due to shifted AtkUnitBase functions.

### Lock Window Position

- **Fixed:** Gear Set List window lock didn't work due to shifted AtkUnitBase functions.

### Portrait Helper

- **Fixed:** Gear checksum mismatched due to shifted number array.

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Fixed:** Currency window didn't switch tabs due to shifted number array.
- **Fixed:** Character -> Reputation didn't switch expansions due to shifted number array.

## [18.0.2] (2023-10-04)

### Portrait Helper

- **Fixed:** Another fix regarding emotes, this time in the Advanced Edit Mode.

## [18.0.1] (2023-10-04)

### Enhanced Login/Logout

- **Fixed:** Playing an emote would crash the game.

## [18.0.0] (2023-10-04)

Update for Patch 6.5.

### HaselTweaks

- **Added:** Options that automatically send network requests are now marked with a yellow bolt âš¡ icon. Not that anything has happened, but I just wanted to let the user know that they are using it at their own risk.
  - At the moment this only applies to Portrait Helper.

### New Tweak: Glamour Dresser Armoire Alert

Opens a small window next to the Glamour Dresser with a list of items that can be stored in the Armoire (only visible if qualified items were found).

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** Companion Bar no longer shows 0/0 experience on rank 20.

### Material Allocation

- **Fixed:** Sanctuary Gathering Log did not update the map for items gathered in the cave.

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Fixed:** Due to an incorrect tab count, it was possible to scroll into hidden tabs of the Key Items window (normal inventory).

## [17.0.2] (2023-09-25)

### Aether Current Helper

- **Fixed:** The list didn't render due to an error.

## [17.0.1] (2023-09-20)

### Enhanced Isleworks Agenda

- **Fixed:** Search Bar got confused when the item list was sorted by Category.

## [17.0.0] (2023-09-20)

### New Tweak: Enhanced Isleworks Agenda

Slightly improves the Isleworks "Set Agenda" window.

Options:

- Enable Search Bar: The search bar is automatically shown and focused when the \"Set Agenda\" window opens. Based on the entered item name, the fuzzy search (lowercase only) selects the item on the right side of the window. Pressing the Enter key confirms the selected item, just like by pressing the \"Schedule\" button.
- Disable item tooltips in the list

## [16.2.2] (2023-09-13)

A lot of internal restructuring due to my new HaselCommon library, which is now used in all my plugins. I hope it works fine!

### Gear Set Grid

- **Fixed:** Closing the window didn't remove it from the WindowManager, making it difficult to reopen.

## [16.2.1] (2023-08-26)

### Commands

- **Fixed:** The rarity color of item links could have been incorrect depending on the UI theme (I misinterpreted the UI colors sheet).

### Gear Set Grid

- **Changed:** The Id column now uses the colored, framed job icon, and the layout has been changed to place the icon above the Id.

## [16.2.0] (2023-08-20)

### Auto Sorter

- **Fixed:** An issue where the `/isort` commands would use parameters based on the plugin language instead of the client language.

### Portrait Helper

- **Added:** A new option "Automatically update portrait" has been added. Thanks to @Rycko1 for helping!  
  This is only for gear sets that do not have a glamour plate linked! It will automatically send a portrait update to the server, when you update the gear set.
- **Fixed:** The reset button should now properly reset the portrait to the initial state of the *current* portrait.

## [16.1.3] (2023-08-19)

### Enhanced Login/Logout

- **Fixed:** Pet glamours should now be applied correctly.

## [16.1.2] (2023-08-18)

### HaselTweaks

- **Fixed:** Text from the Addon sheet wasn't read in the selected language.
- **Fixed:** Text cache was not cleared when switching languages.

### Portrait Helper

- **Changed:** The Animation Timestamp input in the Advanced Edit Mode has been reworked. It is a slider now and supports dragging to scroll through the animation. But, two things:
  - The flickering has not been fixed yet, as it still relies on the same game function that restart/reloads the animation at the specific timestamp.
  - As I understand it, the end timestamp used for the slider is based on the duration of the emote, which is different from the duration of the race-specific animation. Since I can't find the actual animation duration for the life of me, we have to use the general emote duration for now.
- **Fixed:** The overlays didn't update their position when the window moved.

## [16.1.1] (2023-08-17)

### HaselTweaks

- **Fixed:** Changing tweak settings didn't save the config. Sorry about that!

### Portrait Helper

- **Changed:** The overlays should now play nicely with the different UI themes. ðŸŽ‰

## [16.1.0] (2023-08-15)

### HaselTweaks

- **Added:** You can now set the plugins language via a Plugin Configuration menu bar in the plugin window. To toggle the menu bar, click on the gear button in the top right corner. The default language, which was previously determined by the client language, is now whatever is set in Dalamud (if not supported, it defaults to English). You can also choose to automatically use whatever the client is using, or set the language directly.  
  *Please note:* I can only provide full translation in English and German. While French and Japanese are supported as they are part of the game, I only included the few lines I had already translated using ChatGPT. If you want to help translating the plugin into another language, feel free to edit the Translations.json and submit a pull request! :)  
  To avoid confusion I decided not to translate tweak names (for now).

### Aether Current Helper

- **Changed:** The window now hides and unhides automatically with the game UI.

### DTR

- **Added:** A configuration field to change the FPS unit text (default: " fps").

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** The experience bar should no longer get stuck on old data, as it will now try to update it every frame until it's done.

### Gear Set Grid

- **Added:** The id column now has a tooltip with the gear set name and the glamour plate id (if linked).
- **Added:** The id column now also has a context menu to link/change/unlink glamour plates and edit portraits.
- **Changed:** Removed the "Allow switching gearsets" option, because that's the default now.
- **Fixed:** The mouse cursor no longer changes to a hand when hovering over something because gear sets and items can't be dragged out of the ImGui window.

## [16.0.4] (2023-08-05)

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Fixed:** It was not possible to scroll the Chocobo Saddlebag when viewing the retainer inventory.

## [16.0.3] (2023-08-02)

### Background Music Keybind

- **Fixed:** The game would respond to the keybind. Now the key press state is reset after handling it.

### Gear Set Grid

- **Fixed:** Calculating the item level color caused the table to suddenly stop rendering, because it was using a wrong column in the ClassJob sheet.

## [16.0.2] (2023-07-31)

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Fixed:** Scrolling in the Blue Magic Spellbook broke with Patch 6.45.

## [16.0.1] (2023-07-31)

- **Fixed:** I reworked the way the plugin detects when windows are opened/closed in the last update and forgot to check if the window is fully loaded before interacting with it. This update should fix focus issues with the armoury chest when Auto Sorter is enabled.

## [16.0.0] (2023-07-31)

### New Tweak: Background Music Keybind

Adds a configurable keybind to toggle the background music, in addition to the game's existing keybind option to toggle the sound. No more `/bgm` macro. Works in cutscenes.

### New Tweak: Gear Set Grid

A window that displays a grid view of all the items in each gear set, making it easier to figure out which items to upgrade next.  
This is not meant to be a replacement for the Gear Set List window, but rather a supplement to it.

### Commands

- **Added:** New Command `/whatbarding`  
  Target a players chocobo companion and execute the command to see what barding it is wearing.

### Portrait Helper

- **Fixed:** The notification that the gear does not match the portrait did not show up when you were outside of a sanctuary.

## [15.3.3] (2023-07-20)

- **Fixed:** Sometimes the game would freeze, especially when reloading the plugin, due to asynchronously enabling the hooks. Now, the plugin makes sure to enable them on the framework thread.

## [15.3.2] (2023-07-19)

Update for Patch 6.45.

- **Added:** The AGPL 3.0 license has been added to the project.
- **Changed:** The texture cache has been reworked to make it suitable for future use.
- **Changed:** Debug information are now embedded as [Portable PDB](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/Documentation/diagnostics/portable_pdb.md).
- **Fixed:** A signature to set the portrait frame, that had multiple matches after the patch, was replaced.
- **Fixed:** The new Dalamud windows sound effects would play for the portrait helper menu bar and overlays.

## [15.3.1] (2023-07-14)

- Multiple code adjustments due to ClientStructs and Dalamud additions and minor refactoring.
- **Fixed:** An error that occured when unloading the plugin, because a tweak would remove a window from the window system after it has been disposed already.
- **Fixed:** A potential issue with loading icon textures if the path was redirected by Penumbra.

## [15.3.0] (2023-07-10)

### Search the markets

- **Added:** Support for Ehcatl Nine Delivery Quests items (via `/timers`).

## [15.2.0] (2023-07-10)

### Search the markets

- **Added:** Support for Grand Company Delivery Missions items (via `/timers`).

## [15.1.5] (2023-07-08)

Maintenance update with optimizations, bug fixes and a lot of behind-the-scenes changes.

## [15.1.4] (2023-07-01)

### Custom Chat Timestamp

- **Added:** Changing the format will now automatically refresh the chat.

## [15.1.3] (2023-07-01)

### Custom Chat Timestamp

- **Fixed:** Tweak didn't apply when in-game setting "Clock Type" was set to "12-hour Format".

## [15.1.2] (2023-07-01)

### Character Class Switcher

- **Changed:** The message "Couldn't find a suitable gearset." has been translated into German, and using ChatGPT into French and Japanese. Please file a bug if the translation is incorrect.

### Portrait Helper

- **Fixed:** The changes in v15.1.0 broke the logic of the menu bar, so I reworked the way it handles the overlays/windows. Hopefully it's bug-free now.

## [15.1.1] (2023-06-30)

### HaselTweaks

- **Optimized:** Replaced the logo with an SVG, which eliminates the startup lag caused by rebuilding fonts.
- **Fixed:** Logo now also respects Dalamuds Global Font Scale setting.

## [15.1.0] (2023-06-29)

### HaselTweaks

- **Fixed:** Various UI elements now respect Dalamuds Global Font Scale setting.
  > **Note**
  > Portrait Helper overlays will open as windows instead if the global font scale is greater than 12pt.

### Auto Sorter

- **Added:** An option "Sort armoury on job change" (on by default). Sorts only when the armory is open.

### Enhanced Login/Logout

- **Added:** An option "Play emote in character selection" (off by default). Have your character greet you with an emote!  
  To set an emote, you'll need to log in, click the "Change" button, then perform the emote you want to use, and finally click the "Stop Recording" button.
  > **Note**
  > Emote settings are per character and not all emotes are supported (e.g. sitting or underwater emotes). What is supported, however, are alternative standing idle poses.

## [15.0.0] (2023-06-21)

### New Tweak: Enhanced Login/Logout

Login options:

- Show pets in character selection: Displays a carbuncle for Arcanist/Summoner and a fairy for Scholar next to your character. Position is adjustable.
  > **Note**
  > In order to apply the pet glamor settings, you must have logged in at least once.
- Preload territory when queued: When it puts you in queue, it will preload the territory textures in the background, just as it does as when you start teleporting.  
  > **Note**
  > Since I only have SSDs, I don't really know if this works at all.

Logout options:

- Clear tell history on logout

### DTR

- **Fixed:** Sometimes text would not be set, resulting in an empty DTR entry.

## [14.12.1] (2023-06-06)

### HaselTweaks

- **Fixed:** Resolver wouldn't resolve the same signature with different offsets (happened to Forced Cutscene Music).

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** The PvP Series Bar will now update after claiming a rank to clean the claimable rank indicator.

## [14.12.0] (2023-06-03)

### HaselTweaks

- **Optimized:** The plugins setup function is now run in an asynchronous thread to reduce startup lag.

### Aether Current Helper

- **Optimized:** The window is now created on demand.

### DTR

- **Fixed:** Framerate number now correctly rounds up.

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Added:** Support for the Companion window.
- **Added:** Support for the Glamour Dresser window (scrolls pages, not tabs).

## [14.11.3] (2023-05-28)

Maintenance update with optimizations and bug fixes.

### HaselTweaks

- **Fixed:** Disabled buttons now display their intended tooltips again.
- **Optimized:** Multiple hooks now use cached addresses for signatures, which makes the plugin start a bit faster due to less scanning.
- **Optimized:** The FPS display in the DTR tweak now only updates when the frame rate has changed to avoid formatting a number into a string on every frame.

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Fixed:** It was possible to scroll in windows when they were the last thing the cursor hovered before tabbing out. Now scrolling is disabled when the game isn't focused.

## [14.11.2] (2023-05-26)

### Enhanced Material List

- **Fixed:** After closing the "Currency Exchange" window the material list didn't refresh, because I simply forgot to check for this window.
- **Fixed:** "Search for Item by Crafting Method" context menu entry wasn't shown due to wrong offsets.

## [14.11.1] (2023-05-24)

Another update for Patch 6.4 (staging).

- **Search the markets:** Enabled again, because Dalamud.ContextMenu has been updated.

### Known Issues

- **DTR:** Busy status and Instance number are not showing until ClientStructs is updated and shipped with a new Dalamud version.

## [14.11.0] (2023-05-24)

Preliminary update for Patch 6.4 (staging).

### Known Issues

- **DTR:** Busy status and Instance number are not showing until ClientStructs is updated and shipped with a new Dalamud version.
- **Search the markets:** Currently disabled until Dalamud.ContextMenu is updated.

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Added:** Support for the Character window, including Classes/Jobs and Reputation tabs.

## [14.10.0] (2023-05-20)

Some text has been translated into French and Japanese by using ChatGPT (commit [2d24063](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber/HaselTweaks/commit/2d24063)).  
Please file a bug if any translation is incorrect.

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Added:** Support for the Chocobo Saddlebag window.
  - The second tab requires a subscription to the Companion Premium Service.
- **Added:** Support for the Currency window.
- **Fixed:** In the "Open All" Inventory, scrolling over the crystal grid now correctly switches tabs.

## [14.9.3] (2023-05-03)

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** Exiting the Duty Recorder would crash the game, because the experience bar is used immediately after the zone change before it's fully set up.

## [14.9.2] (2023-04-30)

Maintenance update with some internal restructuring and bug fixes.

### HaselTweaks

- **Changed:** For safety, any drawn text is now drawn with `ImGui.TextUnformatted`.
- **Changed:** Configuration fields now have consistent indentation.
- **Changed:** The description for dropdown configuration fields is now correctly below the dropdown.
- **Fixed:** Reset buttons now work correctly when more than one is displayed.

### Custom Chat Timestamp

- **Added:** The configuration now shows the result of the current format with an example message.
- **Added:** The configuration now shows an error if the format is invalid.
- **Added:** The format field in the configuration now has a reset to default button.
- **Fixed:** The timestamp will not be modified if the format field is empty.

## [14.9.1] (2023-04-29)

### Portrait Helper

- **Fixed:** Added some extra gearset id checks (only allows 0 - 99; the game may return 255 if the gearset is not found).

### Search the markets

- **Fixed:** Disabled the context menu entry for collectable items.
- **Fixed:** The HQ symbol is now stripped from the item name.

## [14.9.0] (2023-04-28)

### Custom Chat Timestamp

- **Fixed:** Errors caused by an invalid format are now caught and don't crash the game anymore.

### Portrait Helper

The tweak will now display a notification whenever the appearance and/or gear doesn't match what was saved in the portait (can be disabled).

- **Added:** A new option `Notify if appearance and/or gear doesn't match Portait` (default on):
  - Prints a notification in chat which can be clicked to open the Portrait Editor.
- **Changed:** The option `Re-equip Gearset when it was updated` was renamed to `Try to fix by automatically re-equipping Gearset to reapply Glamour Plate` and now depends on the notification option.
  - The functionality was not changed. Still only works in places where Glamour Plates are allowed to be applied, if the Glamour Plate covers the correct slots and if the gear checksum mismatch was not caused by a mismatch of mainhand/headgear visibility or visor state.

## [14.8.0] (2023-04-23)

Sorry for the quick updates, but I just came up with this solution:

### Portrait Helper

- **Added:** "Re-equip Gearset when it was updated" option (default **off** to prevent confusion).
  - This option ensures the glamour plate is applied after updating the gearset by re-equipping it, which should help with portrait resetting to default. Of course it only works in places where glamour plates are allowed to be applied, if the gearset actually is linked to a glamour plate and if the glamour plate covers the changed slots.

## [14.7.0] (2023-04-23)

### Portrait Helper

- **Removed:** The option "Auto-update Portrait when Gearset was updated", which was added in v0.14.6, didn't work as expected - in fact, it probably did nothing at all. I'm sorry.
- **Fixed:** Under certain conditions the clipboard didn't get closed, which prevented it from working anywhere in Windows until the game was closed.

## [0.14.6] (2023-04-20)

### Portrait Helper

- **Added:** New config option "Auto-update Portrait when Gearset was updated" (default on).
  - This updates the gearset hash in the linked portrait when you save your gearset, so it no longer resets to the default portrait when you changed an item, glamour or the linked glamour plate.

---

Starting with the next release, the versioning will change to make things clearer. The major version (currently 0) will increase when I add/remove/rework tweaks, the minor version (currently 14) will increase when I add/remove things to existing tweaks, and the patch version (currently 6) will increase when I fix things. So don't get confused if it suddenly becomes v14.6.1, v14.7.0 or v15.0.0. ðŸ˜„

## [0.14.5] (2023-04-17)

- **Fixed:** The "Configuration" section title in the Tweak configuration is now hidden when there are no fields to configure.

### Portrait Helper

- **Added:** An Alignment Tool which adds guide lines over the portrait to aid in proper alignment and composition.
  - Hold Shift when clicking the button to open the settings, where you can change the number and color of the lines.

## [0.14.4] (2023-04-11)

### Portrait Helper

- **Fixed:** Apparently copying an image to the clipboard is harder than I thought. Updated the code for better compatibility with programs like Paint and Discord.

## [0.14.3] (2023-04-11)

### Portrait Helper

- **Added:** The preset context menu in the Preset Browser has been expanded to include a "Copy Image" function.
- **Fixed:** To avoid an error when reading the contents of the clipboard, a check has been added to see if any text is present (because you can actually copy other stuff with it, who knew).
- **Fixed:** Restore UI visibility when in Advanced Edit Mode and a game popup was opened (e.g. the close confirmation window or context menu of title bar).

## [0.14.2] (2023-04-10)

### Portrait Helper

- **Changed:** Instead of raw Camera and Camera Target Positions the Advanced Edit Mode now has Yaw, Pitch, Distance, X and Y controls.
  - _Note:_ Due to a bug, I had to disable the input fields for all of them except for Distance. Dragging the fields while holding down the left mouse button should still be fine enough for accurate positioning, even though values might flicker a bit.
- **Added:** Zoom and Rotation controls added to Advanced Edit Mode.

## [0.14.1] (2023-04-09)

### Portrait Helper

- **Added:** An Advanced Edit Mode to precisely set camera position and target, eye and head directions and the animation timestamp, but don't get your hopes up too high - I think the camera uses a spherical coordinate system. Good luck!
- **Fixed:** Some game UI elements did not reappear after closing the Advanced Import or Preset Browser.

## [0.14.0] (2023-04-09)

### Tweak reworked: Portrait Helper

Updated UI and features!

- **Added:** A reset button has been added. This returns the portrait to the state it was in when the window was opened.
- **Added:** Its now possible to save portraits into presets. Use the brand-new preset browser to load presets and organize them using tags. A double click on the preset will load it and you can drag and drop them to easily change their order or add them to tags!
  - _Please note:_ As the list of presets is shared by all tags, but filtered by the selected tag, reordering a preset will change the order across all tags.
- **Changed:** The copy and paste buttons have been replaced by export and import buttons, which make use of the clipboard and export the portrait as a short base64-encoded string.

### Enhanced Material List

- **Fixed:** Due to a condition check being evaluated too late, some gatherable items did not have a zone name.

### Material Allocation

- **Fixed:** Restored a hook to correctly switch tabs when opening the window. Since v0.13.3, it looked like it changed the tabs, but it only updated the buttons, not the content.

## [0.13.7] (2023-04-01)

### Lock Window Position

- **Fixed:** Fixed a game crash caused by an infinite loop due to an overload function removed in v0.13.5 as part of a code cleanup.

## [0.13.6] (2023-03-31)

### Hide MSQ Complete

- **Fixed:** Accidentally flipped a check in v0.13.5.

## [0.13.5] (2023-03-31)

### Auto Sorter

- **Fixed:** Game should no longer crash when EventFramework wasn't available during tweak setup.

## [0.13.4] (2023-03-31)

### Auto Sorter

- **Fixed:** Inventory and Armoury will auto sort again.

## [0.13.3] (2023-03-30)

### Character Class Switcher

- **Fixed:** The tweak now enables DoH buttons when desynthesis is not unlocked.

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** The experience bar will refresh after level syncing for a FATE to remove leftover PvP Series data set by the Max Level Override.

### Material Allocation

- **Fixed:** Sanctuary Gathering Log now correctly switches to the item you clicked on in the Material Allocation window.

## [0.13.2] (2023-03-23)

### Auto-open Recipe

- **Changed:** In addition to daily quests, tribal quests are now also allowed. Duh.

## [0.13.1] (2023-03-21)

### Auto-open Recipe

- **Added:** Support for older daily quests (Ixal and Moogle), which did not return item ids on their objectives.
- **Changed:** Restricted the tweak to daily quests. Just to make sure it doesn't do anything weird.
- **Changed:** Just in case if the player is not on a crafter job, the recipe search will now open. Technically, you shouldn't be able to talk to the NPC/progress the quest in the first place, if you're not a crafter.
- **Fixed:** The check if all materials are available (in your inventory) will now include HQ materials and be calculated correctly when the objective requires you to craft more than one of an item.

### Character Class Switcher

- **Changed:** Now using Dalamuds GameConfig service to detect which button is bound to "Accept".

### Search the markets

- **Fixed:** Item names were not always plain text, causing the search input to bug out.

## [0.13.0] (2023-03-18)

### New Tweak: Auto-open Recipe (Experimental)

When a quest progresses and the new quest step requires an item that can be crafted, and you have all the materials for that item in your inventory, this tweak will automatically open the recipe.

I marked this as experimental because I'm still not 100% sure about some things and have only tested it with a few quests so far (Loporrit daily quests).

### Enhanced Material List

- **Added:** Option to enable the "Search for Item by Crafting Method" context menu entry. No more need to open the recipe tree first.
- **Fixed:** When Zone Names are enabled, it now removes new lines from item names so they can fit in one line.

### DTR

- **Fixed:** It still sometimes didn't display the right instance or busy status, for example after logging out and back in, so I got mad and removed caching of values altogether. Now it just reads the values on each frame.

### Search the markets

- **Added:** Automatically closes the Search Results window when starting a new search.

## [0.12.1] (2023-03-13)

Forgot to update the plugin version in the last release, so please check out the [0.12.0](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber/HaselTweaks/releases/tag/v0.12.0) changes regarding "Refresh Material List", which is now "Enhanced Material List"!

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** Max Level Override should work again. I confused the type of nodes involved.

### Enhanced Material List

- **Added:** Auto-refresh upon closing for Market Board Search Results and Vendor windows.
- **Added:** Restore Material List on Login: The material list will reopen with the same recipe and quantity each time you log in as long as the window is locked.

## [0.12.0] (2023-03-08)

### Tweak reworked: Refresh Material List -> Enhanced Material List

- **Added:** Enable Zone Names: Displays a zone name underneath the item name indicating where it can be gathered. Only the zone with the lowest teleportation cost is displayed. If the name is green it means it's the current zone. Since space is limited it has to shorten the item and zone name.
  - An option is available to disable this for Crystals.
- **Added:** Enable click to open Map: Allows you to open the map with the gathering marker in said zone.
  - An option is available to disable this for Crystals.
- **Changed:** Auto-refresh Material List/Auto-refresh Recipe Tree separated and converted to options.

### Character Class Switcher

- **Fixed:** The game no longer crashes when checking which button was pressed.  
  _Dev Note:_ This is a result of config IDs changing with each patch. I've reworked the function to find the config option by name and no longer rely on ClientStructs being updated with the correct IDs.

## [0.11.2] (2023-03-07)

Preliminary update for Patch 6.35.

### Lock Window Position

- **Fixed:** Configuration will now save when toggling the enable state of a window lock.  
  This wasn't really worth a hotfix, since the configuration is saved when the plugin unloads (e.g. when closing the game).

## [0.11.1] (2023-03-01)

### Lock Window Position

- **Added:** A config option to invert the logic (locks all windows).

### Tweak reworked: Material Allocation

- **Added:** A config option to enable clicking on gatherable items to open the Sanctuary Gathering Log (enabled by default).

## [0.10.0] (2023-02-22)

### New Tweak: Lock Window Position

Lock window positions so they can't move.

Adds a context menu entry for the title bar to "Lock/Unlock Position" (can be disabled).  
Alternatively it's possible to add windows by using the window picker in the configuration.

### Auto Sorter

- **Fixed:** After clicking the Enable/Disable checkbox, the configuration is saved.

### DTR

- **Fixed:** Changed the conditions for the busy state so that it no longer disappears immediately after switching zones.

### Material Allocation

- **Changed:** Tweak reworked, so that the game doesn't fire an extra network packet on opening the window.

### Search the markets

- **Changed:** Added an orange H for HaselTweaks in front of the context menu entry.

## [0.9.8] (2023-02-14)

### DTR

## [0.9.7] (2023-02-13)

### DTR

- **Fixed:** Changed the conditions for the instance indicator so that it no longer hides immediately after being displayed.

### DTR

- **Fixed:** Changed the conditions for the busy state so that it no longer disappears immediately after being displayed.

## [0.9.3] (2023-01-31)

### Auto Sorter

- **Added:** To prevent accidentally deleting a rule, you must now hold down the shift key to make the button clickable.
- **Changed:** Run rule buttons are now disabled when the Tweak is disabled or rules are queued.
- **Changed:** When a rule is disabled (for example, when the needed window isn't open), the Run button is disabled instead of displaying an error.
- **Changed:** All in-game armoury sorters are now checked for readiness before sorting.
- **Fixed:** Disabling the tweak now clears the queue.

## [0.9.2] (2023-01-30)

### Auto Sorter

- **Added:** To prevent the right saddlebag sorter from running and returning an error a detection was added whether the player is subscribed to the Companion Premium Service.
- **Added:** To prevent the retainer sorter from running and returning an error a detection was added whether the retainer window is open.
- **Changed:** A queue system was implemented, so the game has time between each frame to complete its sorting.
- **Fixed:** The armoury category and its subcategories will now wait for completion of the in-games sorting mechanism before running.
- **Fixed:** A copy-paste mistake has been corrected for the HQ condition for the Japanese client.

## [0.9.1] (2023-01-26)

### Auto Sorter

- **Changed:** It's now possible to add more rules for the same category, allowing to sort with multiple conditions.
- **Added:** A "Run All" button for easy testing.

## [0.9.0] (2023-01-25)

### New Tweak: Auto Sorter

This one replaces "Auto Sort Armoury Chest" and "Auto Sort Inventory", which didn't last long, in a more general Auto Sorter (hence the name). I just couldn't resist. :D  
Since I can't easily convert the configurations, you have to add rules yourself.

## [0.8.2] (2023-01-25)

### DTR

- **Fixed:** DTRs without data will be hidden again.

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** Messed up signature for PvP Stats.

Just like "Auto Sort Armoury Chest", but for inventory. ([PR](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber/HaselTweaks/pull/22) by [53m1k0l0n](https://github.com/53m1k0l0n). Thanks!)

## [0.7.14] (2023-01-23)

### Refresh Material List

- **Fixed:** Possible crash fix.

### Scrollable Tabs

- **Fixed:** Minions and Mounts windows should be able to scroll out of favorites again.

## [0.7.2] (2022-09-04)

### Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Fixed:** Island Sanctuary experience broke in last update. It's fixed now.

## [0.7.0] (2022-09-02)

### Tweak reworked: Series Exp Bar -> Enhanced Experience Bar

- **Added:** Max Level Override setting.
  - Will switch to the selected bar if your current job is on max level and none of the other settings apply.

## [0.3.2] (2022-08-10)

### Character Class Switcher

Always equips the gearset with the highest average item level.

Always opens the Grand Company Delivery Missions window on the third tab (Expert Delivery).

Opens duty finder for the duty you clicked on in the Wondrous Tails Journal.
